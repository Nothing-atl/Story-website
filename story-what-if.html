            &nbsp &nbsp We were lying face to face under the blanket. On the same pillow. Our faces merely two inches apart. Our legs were tangled together. And our warm breaths were mingling in the space between us.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Her chest was rising and falling in sync with mine.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp With her trembling fingers, she started tracing the edge of my jawline. I rested the flat of my palm on her cheek, and caressed her lips with my thumb, slowly wiping her glossy pink lipstick.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Our eyes stayed locked, as I, suddenly, slid my hand into her hair and, gripping tightly, pulled her closer.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Our lips touched. She gasped.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Her breath now felt hot against my face.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp The kiss began slow. My lips explored the taste of hers, her lips explored the taste of mine. Slowly and gently. Inside the blanket, our breathing started sounding louder.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp She parted her lips, and I responded immediately by inserting my tongue into her mouth. Our tongues touched. And that touch shivered us both. Her heart began to pound against my chest. As my tongue twisted around hers, she pushed me on my back and climbed up on me. The kiss turned desperate and dangerous. She pressed her lips harder onto mine; her tongue slipped deeper my mouth. We both needed air, but we didn't want to break away that kiss. We weren't merely kissing now, but inhaling each-other too. Our breaths also achieved a perfect rhythm. As I exhaled, she inhaled, and as she exhaled, I inhaled. Gasping, panting, puffing, we continued kissing. My hand was still in her hair, and the other moved on her back. I was trying to pull her deeper into my body. And she was, as if, trying to pull me up, into her.<br> 
            &nbsp &nbsp As we struggled to pull ourselves into each-other, the taste of kiss changed too. It was sugary, and now it started tasting slightly salty, as if our lips were swelling. The kiss continued though, and our breaths, turning louder and longer, took the temperature inside the blanked to a dangerous degree. But we were not going to end that kiss, not that night, even ifour breaths burned us. And breathlessly, we kept on kissing
