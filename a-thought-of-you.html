        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp It always started the same way—a fleeting thought, a passing memory of her laugh or the way her eyes crinkled when she smiled. But once the thought of her surfaced, it was impossible to let it go. She had a way of occupying my mind, filling the quiet moments with her presence even when she wasn’t there.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Tonight was no different. The room was dark, lit only by the soft glow of the city lights spilling through the window. I sat on the edge of my bed, my phone resting on the table beside me, untouched. The world outside felt distant, muted. And in that stillness, she crept back into my thoughts.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I thought about the way she always seemed to light up a room without even trying. The way her voice carried warmth, like a favorite song you never got tired of hearing. I could almost see her now, leaning back in her chair, her hair falling loosely over her shoulders, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her sleeve as she talked about something that excited her. She had a way of making the simplest things sound magical.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I wondered what she was doing right now—whether she was lying in bed, her hair spread out on the pillow, or curled up on her couch with her favorite book. Was she thinking about me, too? The thought made my chest tighten, a strange mix of hope and longing.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp It wasn’t just the big things about her that stayed with me; it was the little things, too. The way she tilted her head when she was curious. The way she always tucked a strand of hair behind her ear when she was nervous. The way she looked at me—like I was something worth seeing.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I leaned back, staring at the ceiling, letting my thoughts wander. I remembered the time she caught me staring at her and asked, “What?” with that half-smile, half-laugh that made my heart skip. I didn’t have an answer then, and I probably wouldn’t have one now. How could I explain that I was just... mesmerized?<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp It was ridiculous, really, how much space she occupied in my mind. But it wasn’t just infatuation—it was something deeper, something that lingered even in the quietest moments. She made me want to be better, not because she asked for it, but because she deserved it.<br> 
            &nbsp &nbsp The clock ticked softly in the background, pulling me out of my reverie. I glanced at my phone again, debating whether to send a text. Would she think it was too late? Would she think I was being too forward? My thumb hovered over her name, the weight of unspoken feelings pressing down on me.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I sighed, setting the phone down again. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe then I’d find the words to tell her what I’d been thinking—that she had a way of turning even the dullest days into something brighter, something worth remembering.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp For now, I closed my eyes, letting her image settle in my mind like a quiet, steady rhythm. The thought of her was enough to keep me company tonight.
