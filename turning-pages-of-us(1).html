            &nbsp;&nbsp; The party was winding down, soft laughter and distant music fading into the night as people began to trickle out. I leaned against the kitchen counter, nursing a glass of soda, watching her from across the room. She was laughing—head thrown back, cheeks flushed, her curly hair falling wildly over her shoulders. She’d always been beautiful, but tonight? Tonight she was radiant, a magnet I couldn’t resist being pulled toward.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She stumbled slightly as she set her drink down, catching herself on the back of a chair. Her eyes darted around the room and landed on me. A smile broke across her face—lazy, warm, and just a little too bright. She was tipsy, maybe more than tipsy, and I felt the faint stir of concern.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Hey,” I called softly as she wove her way through the thinning crowd. “You okay?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped in front of me, swaying slightly, her gaze hazy but locked on mine. “I’m great,” she said, dragging the word out in a way that made me chuckle. “But you—” She poked a finger at my chest, her nail tapping against the fabric of my shirt. “You’ve been avoiding me.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked. “What? I haven’t been—”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, you have,” she interrupted, leaning closer. The scent of her perfume mixed with the faint tang of wine on her breath. “All night, you’ve been over here, hiding in the corner, pretending not to notice me.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My heart skipped a beat. She was standing so close now, her face inches from mine, her eyes searching mine with a clarity that belied the alcohol in her system. “I wasn’t avoiding you,” I said softly. “I’ve just... been giving you space.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Space?” She laughed, a little too loudly, drawing the attention of a couple nearby. She didn’t seem to care. “I don’t need space from you.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Okay,” I said carefully, trying to gauge where this was going. “What do you need?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her laughter died, and for a moment, she just looked at me, her expression unreadable. Then, without warning, she grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the kitchen, down the hall, and into the quiet sanctuary of the guest room. She closed the door behind us, leaning against it as if to keep the rest of the world out.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “What’s going on?” I asked, my voice low.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She hesitated, her fingers gripping the doorknob. “I need to tell you something,” she said finally, her words slower, more deliberate. “And if I don’t say it now, I might never have the courage to.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My stomach twisted. “Okay,” I said cautiously. “What is it?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She took a step closer, then another, until she was right in front of me. Her hand lifted, her fingers brushing against my cheek in a way that sent a shiver down my spine. “I like you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “Not just as a friend. Not just... casually. I like you. And I’ve liked you for so long, I don’t even remember what it feels like not to.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My breath caught. “You’re drunk,” I said, though my voice lacked conviction.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “I am,” she admitted, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “But that doesn’t make this any less true.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at her, my mind racing. This was the moment I’d dreamed of, but it felt surreal, like the floor had shifted beneath me. “You don’t mean that,” I said weakly. “You’re just—”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Stop,” she said, her hands gripping my shoulders now, grounding me in place. “Don’t tell me what I do or don’t feel. I’ve been in love with you for years, and it’s been eating me alive because I was too scared to say anything. But tonight? I just—” She broke off, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “I couldn’t keep it in anymore.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My chest felt tight, like all the air had been sucked out of the room. “You... love me?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She nodded, her gaze never wavering. “I love you,” she said simply. “And if you don’t feel the same, that’s okay. I’ll survive. But I had to tell you. I had to.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, neither of us moved, the silence stretching between us like a fragile thread. And then, as if something inside me snapped, I closed the gap between us, my hands cupping her face as I kissed her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She froze for a split second before melting into me, her arms wrapping around my neck as she kissed me back with a fervor that left me breathless. Her lips were soft and warm, and I tasted the faint tang of wine as her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me closer.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The kiss deepened, growing more urgent, more desperate, as if all the unspoken words and pent-up emotions of the past few years were pouring out of us in that moment. My hands slid to her waist, holding her against me, and she sighed into my mouth, her body pressing into mine like she couldn’t get close enough.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; When we finally broke apart, gasping for air, her forehead rested against mine, her breath warm against my lips. “I guess you do feel the same,” she said, her voice tinged with nervous laughter.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled, my thumb brushing against her cheek. “You have no idea how much.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed softly, her eyes shining as she leaned in for another kiss. And in that moment, nothing else mattered—not the party, not the world outside, not even the fact that tomorrow might bring questions or complications. All that mattered was her, here, now, and the love that had finally found its voice.<br>
