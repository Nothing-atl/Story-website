        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning light filtered softly through the curtains, casting a warm glow across the room. The air was still, the quiet only broken by the faint hum of the coffee machine in the kitchen. I stood there, waiting as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the space, bringing a sense of calm to the start of the day.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The two mugs on the counter looked almost too full, the steam curling up in lazy tendrils. One was mine—made with only milk and coffee powder, no water, just the way I liked it. The other, hers, was a little sweeter, with just the right amount of milk and sugar, exactly how she insisted it had to be.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Carrying both mugs carefully, I made my way back to the bedroom. She was still curled up under the blanket, her hair spilling across the pillow in a messy halo. The soft rise and fall of her breathing told me she was awake, even though her eyes remained closed. I smiled at the sight, the peacefulness of it all.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Good morning,” I said softly, setting her mug on the bedside table.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes fluttered open, and she blinked up at me, her lips curving into a sleepy smile. “Morning,” she murmured, her voice thick with the remnants of sleep.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I handed her the mug, careful not to spill, and she sat up slightly, the blanket slipping from her shoulders. “You’re spoiling me,” she teased, cradling the warm ceramic between her hands.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Maybe,” I said, sitting on the edge of the bed with my own coffee. “But you make it worth it.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed softly, the sound still heavy with sleep but no less beautiful. Her first sip was slow, deliberate, and I watched as her shoulders relaxed, the warmth of the coffee doing its work.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “This,” she said, holding up the mug, “is why I keep you around.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I raised an eyebrow, pretending to be offended. “Not for my charm? My wit? My devastatingly good looks?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Those are bonuses,” she replied, smirking over the rim of her mug. “But coffee in bed? That’s love.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her teasing made me laugh, but there was something about the way she said it, the way her smile softened, that made my chest feel impossibly full. I reached out, brushing a strand of hair away from her face. “Anything to make you smile like that,” I said quietly.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She leaned into my touch, her eyes meeting mine with that sleepy, unguarded look that always made me feel like the luckiest person alive. “You’re too good to me,” she murmured, setting her mug down and shifting closer.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Never,” I said, wrapping an arm around her and pulling her against me. She rested her head on my shoulder, her hands still cradling the warmth of her coffee. The scent of her shampoo mixed with the rich aroma of the coffee, creating a quiet, perfect bubble that the rest of the world couldn’t touch.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a while, we just sat there, the morning stretching lazily before us. Her breaths grew steadier, her body relaxed against mine, and the coffee in our hands slowly cooled. But neither of us moved, unwilling to break the moment.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; As the sunlight crept higher, spilling across the bed in golden streams, she looked up at me, her eyes still heavy with sleep but bright with something else. “You know,” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper, “this might be my favorite part of every day.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. “Mine too.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And as we sat there, wrapped in each other and the warmth of the morning, I couldn’t help but wish that every day could start exactly like this.<br>
