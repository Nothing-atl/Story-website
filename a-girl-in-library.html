        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The library was quiet, a sanctuary of whispered voices and the soft rustle of turning pages. Dust motes danced lazily in the streams of sunlight pouring through the tall windows, giving the space a serene, almost sacred feel. I was tucked away in a corner, my books spread out on the table in an attempt to look busy, but my focus had long since drifted.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; That’s when I saw her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She was standing by the fiction shelves, her head tilted slightly as she scanned the spines. Her hair fell in loose waves over her shoulders, catching the light just enough to make it shine. She wore a sweater that looked impossibly soft, the sleeves slightly too long, and her fingers absently toyed with the edge of the fabric.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; There was something about the way she moved—graceful yet unassuming, as if she belonged perfectly in this quiet world of books. She reached up to pull a novel from the shelf, her lips curving into a small smile as she read the back cover. I couldn’t see what the book was, but the way her face lit up made me wish I could.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I told myself to look away, to focus on my work, but my eyes refused to listen. Instead, they followed her as she moved to a nearby table, setting the book down and pulling out a chair. She sat with her legs crossed, leaning slightly forward as she flipped through the pages, completely absorbed.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; It was mesmerizing. The way her fingers traced the lines of text, the way her expression shifted as she read curiosity, amusement, the faintest hint of wonder. It was like watching someone step into another world, and I couldn’t help but feel drawn to her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, she looked up, her gaze sweeping the room briefly before landing on me. My heart jumped. I quickly looked down at my notebook, pretending to write something, but the damage was done. I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks, my pulse quickening as I cursed myself for staring.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I chanced a glance back, and to my surprise, she was smiling just a small, knowing smile, like she had caught me but didn’t mind. It was enough to make my chest ache, and for a moment, I considered getting up, walking over, and saying something. But what would I even say? What if I ruined the quiet magic of the moment?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; So I stayed where I was, watching from a distance as she turned back to her book. The minutes stretched on, each one feeling both endless and far too short. I didn’t want to leave, didn’t want this fleeting connection to end.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; When she finally stood, slipping the book into her bag and heading toward the door, I felt a pang of regret. I wanted to stop her, to ask her name, to say anything that might make her stay a little longer. But my feet stayed rooted to the ground, and all I could do was watch as she disappeared through the library’s heavy doors.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, I wonder who she was, what book had captured her attention, and if she noticed me the way I noticed her. But one thing is certain she turned an ordinary afternoon in the library into something extraordinary, a moment I might not forget.<br>
