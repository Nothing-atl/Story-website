            &nbsp &nbsp The room was dimly lit, the only sound the faint hum of the night outside. We sat close, our legs brushing against each other as we leaned in, the space between us growing smaller with every passing moment. Her gaze lingered on me, warm and inviting, as if daring me to move closer.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I reached out, my fingers trailing softly along her arm, feeling the goosebumps rise beneath my touch. She closed her eyes for a moment, tilting her head slightly to the side, a subtle invitation that made my heart race. My hand moved to her shoulder, then up to gently tuck a strand of hair behind her ear.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp As her neck was revealed, smooth and bare, I couldn’t resist leaning in. My lips hovered over her skin, and I could feel the warmth radiating from her, the faint scent of her perfume filling the air between us.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp The first kiss was light, barely there—a whisper of touch just below her ear. She shivered, her breath hitching, and I heard the softest sigh escape her lips. Emboldened, I pressed another kiss to the curve of her neck, this one slower, lingering. Her fingers found their way to my hair, curling into it as if to keep me close.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Her pulse quickened beneath my lips, and I could feel it, steady and alive, as I continued to kiss her neck—each touch deliberate, each one slower than the last. I traced a line of kisses down to her collarbone, my lips brushing her skin with just enough pressure to make her breath catch.
<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Her body leaned into mine, her hands slipping to my shoulders as she tilted her head back, granting me more access. The way she responded, the way her breath deepened, made my own pulse race. I kissed her just below her jawline, the soft skin there impossibly warm.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I could hear her breathing now, soft and ragged, her chest rising and falling in rhythm with mine. Each kiss felt like a conversation, unspoken yet deeply understood, and as I pulled her closer, her hands tightened on me, grounding me in the moment.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp When I finally pulled back, just enough to meet her eyes, they were half-lidded, her lips parted in a breathless smile. Her fingers brushed against my cheek, and she whispered, her voice barely audible, “Don’t stop.”<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And I didn’t.
