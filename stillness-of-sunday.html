        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The church was peaceful, the faint scent of candles and polished wood filling the air. As I walked through the heavy doors, a familiar calm washed over me—but it only lasted a moment. Because then I saw her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting a few pews ahead, her head slightly bowed, her hands clasped gently in her lap. Her pink sweater stood out softly against the muted colors of the church, a delicate hue that seemed to suit her perfectly. Her curly hair framed her face beautifully, and as she glanced to the side, the gentle overhead lights cast a soft glow on her profile, making her look almost ethereal.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My steps faltered, my heart skipping a beat. For a moment, everything else—the quiet murmurs of prayer, the shuffle of footsteps—faded away. She was all I could see.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I slid into a pew, somewhere behind her, and tried to focus on the mass. But no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to her. The way she tilted her head slightly when she listened, the soft curve of her smile when someone near her whispered something. She had this presence, this warmth, that made it impossible to look anywhere else.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; When the service ended, I lingered, watching as she stood and smoothed her sweater before walking toward the church’s small coffee stand. My mind raced. Should I approach her? Say something? But what would I even say? Would she even remember me?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I told myself I’d stay where I was, but my feet betrayed me, carrying me toward the coffee stand as if on autopilot. The line was short, and I found myself standing a few steps away from her, close enough to notice the way she brushed a strand of hair behind her ear, the way her smile lit up her face as she thanked the volunteer handing her a cup.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And then, just as she turned, her eyes met mine.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi,” she said, her voice warm and soft, accompanied by a small wave.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a second, I froze. I don’t know why, but nerves hit me like a tidal wave. My hand felt awkward and heavy as I lifted it to wave back. “Hi,” I managed to say, my voice quieter than I intended.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her smile widened slightly, and for a moment, I thought she was going to say something else. But someone else stepped up beside her, pulling her attention away, and she turned back to her group with one last glance in my direction.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I stood there for a few moments, my coffee forgotten, my thoughts a blur. I couldn’t figure out why she had such an effect on me, why one simple word and wave had made my chest tighten and my mind stumble. But as I watched her laugh softly with the people around her, I couldn’t help but smile.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, as I walked away, her pink sweater and that soft smile stayed with me, replaying in my mind. I didn’t know what it meant, or if she’d even think of me again, but one thing was certain—maybe she’s the reason I find myself at church every Sunday….<br>
