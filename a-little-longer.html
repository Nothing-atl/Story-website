        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its hands moving with a rhythm that seemed faster than it should. The sun had already dipped below the horizon, leaving the room bathed in the soft glow of string lights we’d hung together weeks ago. Outside, the world carried on cars passing, distant laughter from the neighbors, but in here, everything felt quieter, smaller, as if the universe had folded itself around us.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp She stood in front of me, her arms loosely crossed, her eyes holding that warm, familiar look that always made my chest ache in the best way. It was one of those moments where words felt unnecessary, even intrusive, as though anything spoken would break the fragile perfection of the silence between us. <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I took a step closer, closing the space between us, and without a word, I wrapped my arms around her. Her body melted into mine, her arms sliding around my waist, and she rested her head against my chest. She sighed softly, the sound carrying a quiet relief, and I felt her fingers grip the back of my shirt, holding on as if she didn’t want to let go. <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp The hug started slow, almost tentative, but as the seconds passed, it deepened. I pulled her closer, my arms tightening around her as if I could shield her from the rest of the world. Her warmth seeped into me, chasing away the chill of the evening, and I buried my face in her hair, breathing her in. She smelled like vanilla and the faintest hint of lavender, a scent that felt like home.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Time seemed to blur. I couldn’t tell if it had been seconds or minutes, but it didn’t matter. In that moment, there was nothing else no ticking clock, no responsibilities waiting for us just the steady rise and fall of her breath against me and the way her heartbeat seemed to sync with mine.
<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp “Do you ever wish we could just stop time?” she murmured, her voice muffled against my chest.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I smiled, my hand moving to the small of her back, tracing lazy circles. “Every time I’m with you,” I replied softly. “It’s like it’s slipping away too fast.”<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp She tilted her head back slightly, just enough to meet my eyes. There was a wistfulness in her gaze, a quiet longing that mirrored my own. “It feels like no matter how long we have, it’s never enough,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I nodded, my forehead resting gently against hers. “Then let’s just stay like this a little longer,” I said. “Let’s not think about anything else.”         <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp Her arms tightened around me, and she closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her lips. “Okay,” she said. “Just a little longer.” <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp We stood there, holding each other, as the world outside continued to turn. Minutes, hours, neither of us cared. All that mattered was the way her warmth felt against me, the way her fingers traced the curve of my back, and the way time seemed to bend and stretch, allowing us this fleeting eternity.<br> 
            &nbsp &nbsp Eventually, the clock chimed faintly in the background, reminding us that the moment couldn’t last forever. She sighed again, pulling back slightly but keeping her hands on my waist, her gaze lingering on mine.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you,” she said softly, her smile filled with something I couldn’t quite name but knew I never wanted to lose.<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp I leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. “For what?”<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp “For making time feel like it stops,” she said. “Even if just for a little while.”<br>
            &nbsp &nbsp And as I pulled her close for one last hug, I silently wished that moments like this could last forever.<br>
