            &nbsp;&nbsp; The kitchen was filled with the soft sizzle of eggs on the stovetop and the warm, comforting smell of butter melting on toast. The early morning sunlight streamed through the window, casting a golden glow across the room. She stood by the counter, her hair loosely tied back, wearing one of my oversized sweaters that looked far better on her than it ever did on me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She hummed quietly, some tune I didn’t recognize but instantly loved just because it came from her. Her movements were effortless—flipping the eggs, reaching for the salt shaker—completely unaware of how captivating she looked in that moment.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I leaned against the doorway for a while, just watching her. There was something about the way she carried herself, even in the simplest of moments, that made me feel an ache in my chest. An ache that wasn’t painful but full, like my heart was trying to hold more than it could handle.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Unable to resist, I walked up behind her, slipping my arms around her waist. Her body tensed for the briefest second before relaxing into me, a soft laugh escaping her lips.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “You scared me,” she said, her voice tinged with amusement as she turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at me over her shoulder.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Sorry,” I murmured, my chin resting lightly on her shoulder. “You just looked too cute not to hug.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She rolled her eyes, but the smile that spread across her face betrayed her. “Cute? I’m literally cooking eggs.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Exactly,” I said, tightening my arms around her slightly. “No one’s ever looked this good while flipping eggs.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed again, shaking her head as she reached for a spatula. “You’re ridiculous.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Maybe,” I said, burying my face in the crook of her neck. Her skin was warm and smelled faintly of vanilla, a scent that made the world outside this moment feel irrelevant. “But you love me anyway.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She paused, the spatula hovering over the pan as if she were pretending to think about it. “Hmm, I guess I do,” she teased, her tone playful.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I grinned, my hands moving to rest lightly on her hips. “You guess?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “I definitely do,” she said, leaning back slightly into me, her voice softening. “Happy now?”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Very,” I replied, pressing a light kiss to her shoulder.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a while, we just stood there, her body nestled against mine as the warmth of the stove radiated in front of us. She stirred the eggs absently, as though the cooking had become secondary to the moment between us. My arms stayed wrapped around her, holding her close, and I felt the steady rhythm of her breathing, the rise and fall syncing with my own.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “You know,” she said after a while, her voice quiet, “if you keep holding me like this, breakfast is going to burn.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Let it,” I said softly. “This is better.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She turned her head again, her eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, neither of us said anything. The sound of the sizzling pan, the warmth of the kitchen, the sunlight dancing around us—it all faded away. There was only her and the way she looked at me, her lips curving into that smile that always made time feel like it stopped.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Alright,” she said, her voice a little breathless, “but you’re flipping the next batch.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Deal,” I said, my arms tightening once more before I reluctantly let her go.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; As she turned back to the stove, I stayed close, my hands still resting lightly on her waist. The breakfast may have been simple, but the moment was anything but. And as the smell of perfectly cooked eggs filled the air, I couldn’t help but think that this—her, me, and mornings like this—was exactly where I wanted to be.<br>
