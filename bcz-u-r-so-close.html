            &nbsp;&nbsp; The evening was cool, the faint hum of the city lingering in the distance as we stood outside, waiting for the night to settle. The stars above were faint, barely visible against the city lights, but somehow, the moment felt infinite.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She stood close, her arms crossed against the slight chill, her breath forming little clouds in the cold air. “I can’t believe I forgot my jacket,” she said, laughing softly.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Here,” I said, without thinking, slipping off my hoodie and draping it over her shoulders. She hesitated for a moment, then smiled, pulling it tighter around her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Thanks,” she said, her voice quieter now. “You’re always so thoughtful.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I shrugged, trying to play it off, but my heart had already started its wild drumbeat. She looked at me then, her eyes soft, her smile laced with something that made my chest ache in the best way.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Come here,” she said suddenly, stepping closer. Before I could react, her arms wrapped around me in a hug. A real hug tight, warm, her head resting lightly against my chest.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, I froze. My hands hovered awkwardly in the air, unsure of where to go, but then they found their way to her back, pulling her just a little closer. She fit perfectly, like she belonged there, and the warmth of her presence chased away every chill in the night.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And then I realized it my heart. It was pounding, loud and insistent, like it was trying to make itself known. I held my breath, hoping she wouldn’t notice, but she did.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She tilted her head up slightly, her chin resting against my chest, her eyes meeting mine. “Why is your heart beating so fast?” she asked, her voice curious but soft, her lips curving into a playful smile.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; My mind raced. I thought of a dozen answers, all of them inadequate. But the truth the only thing I could think was simple: Because you’re so close to me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The words formed in my mind, clear and insistent, but they stayed there, stuck in my throat. I couldn’t say them. Instead, I forced out a laugh, trying to steady myself. “Maybe... it’s just cold out,” I said weakly.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced. “You’re wearing a t-shirt,” she said, her tone playful. “You don’t seem cold.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I swallowed hard, forcing a small smile. “I don’t know. Maybe I just wasn’t ready for that hug.”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her laughter rang out softly, her body still pressed against mine. “You’re terrible at lying,” she said, but her tone was light, her fingers tightening slightly on my back.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I held her a little closer, her warmth seeping into me. My heart was still racing, but I didn’t care anymore. I couldn’t tell her the truth not yet. Instead, I just let myself enjoy the moment, the way her head fit perfectly against my chest, the way her scent light and floral seemed to wrap around me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The world around us faded, the cold, the city sounds, everything but her. My thoughts lingered on the words I couldn’t say, repeating them silently as if she might hear them anyway: Because you’re so close to me. Because it’s you.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And as she stayed in my arms, neither of us moving, I silently wished for the courage to say them aloud one day. But for now, this was enough.<br>
