        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I never thought one tiny decision could shake an entire universe. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;It all started when I uninstalled WhatsApp for just one day. One single day. No status, no DP, no last seen..nothing. A clean disappearance. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Within hours, her world turned upside down. <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;First, she checked my chat. “Last seen… gone??”<br>
                         Then she checked my profile. “DP… gone??”<br>
                        Then she refreshed. Again. And again. And again.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;By evening, she was pacing around like a detective solving a murder case.<br> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “where is my Aleena!” she asked everyone.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She messaged my friends.<br>
She checked mutual groups.<br>
She even asked random people, “Did she block me? Did she delete me? Did aliens kidnap her?!” <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;“I think she left the whole world… she didn’t even tell ME. I’m going to cry.” <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; For a whole day she searched, waited, refreshed, rechecked… hoping my online bubble would appear again.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And when I finally came back the next morning cool, calm, and casual.. she literally burst out:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “WHERE WERE YOU?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE I ASKED TO FIND YOU?!”<br>
Her voice shaking. Her eyes watery.<br>
Her heart? Completely dramatic.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn’t help but laugh, but deep down it felt nice.<br> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Because in that one day…<br>
someone cared enough to miss me, worry for me, and search for me like I was the last cookie in the jar.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And that girl?<br>
She’ll probably never let me uninstall anything again.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
