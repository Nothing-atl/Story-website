        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; The church was alive with the spirit of Christmas. The soft glow of candles lit the room, casting flickering shadows on the walls adorned with garlands and wreaths. Voices lifted in carols filled the air, accompanied by the faint scent of pine and wax. It was the kind of evening that felt timeless, like a scene from a memory you didn’t realize you’d cherished.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And then I saw her.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She stood near the nativity display, her green dress catching the candlelight as she smiled and spoke with the group around her. Her laughter, soft and warm, drifted through the air, and even though there were dozens of people in the room, she was all I could see. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear, the gentle tilt of her head as she listened—it all seemed effortless, like she belonged to the magic of the night.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn’t sure if she noticed me. I lingered at the edge of the room, watching her, caught between the fear of being unnoticed and the fear of being seen. She had an energy that pulled me in, but I hesitated, unsure if I belonged in her orbit.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I found the courage to approach her. My heart pounded with every step until I stood just a few feet away.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi,” I said, my voice barely louder than a whisper.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She turned, her eyes meeting mine. They were warm, curious, and for a moment, I forgot what I was going to say.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; “I... I just wanted to ask your name,” I managed, feeling my cheeks warm under her gaze.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Her lips curved into a soft smile, and she leaned in closer, her hair falling slightly forward as she brought her lips near my ear. My breath caught as I felt the faintest brush of air against my skin when she spoke.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; But I didn’t hear it.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t hear her name, or maybe I did, but it was lost in the haze of the moment. Everything around us seemed to blur, fading into the background until there was only her. The warmth of her presence, the scent of her perfume, the way her voice sounded like it was meant to be a secret just for me—it all consumed me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; She leaned back, her eyes searching mine, as if waiting for me to respond. I opened my mouth, but no words came. Instead, I nodded dumbly, hoping she couldn’t see how utterly she had disarmed me.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; Before I could gather myself, someone called her name from across the room. She turned, waving to a friend, then gave me one last glance. “It was nice meeting you,” she said, her voice carrying a smile as she walked away.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; And just like that, she was gone.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; I stood there, rooted in place, the noise of the room slowly coming back to me. I didn’t know if she noticed the way I looked at her, if she felt the same spark I did in that brief exchange. I didn’t even know her name.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; But even now, I think about her—the girl in the green dress at Christmas. The one who turned a quiet night at church into something unforgettable. And I wonder, does she remember me, too?<br>
